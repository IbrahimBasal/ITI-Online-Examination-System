# ITI-Online-Examination-System
Our Graduation Project focused on developing an "Examination System" that enables the creation and management of exams, evaluation of student performance, and generation of reports.

To achieve this
First, we created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to map out the DataFlow. We then proceeded to create database tables and constraints and used SSIS to import
data from Excel sheets into the SQL database.

Second, We developed
1- Series of efficient Stored Procedures for streamlined operations, including data retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion.
2- Our main Stored Procedures included
>Random Exam Generation.
>Evaluating Student Answers.
>Calculating Total Grade for a Student in their Courses.
3- Six additional Stored Procedures to use in SSRS reports and dashboards.

Third, To enhance data visualization and analysis capabilities, we developed a set of PowerBI dashboards to provide a better understanding of the data and 
help visualize the performance of the system.
You can interact with this dashboard and review it on novyPro ðŸš€:

Finally, We developed a desktop application that allows students to enroll and take exams in their courses and view their results, 
making the system more user-friendly.
